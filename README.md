# Banana Bulletin 
## _Broadened perspectives on news_

Banana Bulletin is a browser-extension that, upon visiting a news article, recommends users a broad range of articles from *other* publications on the same topic. It provides statistics on each recommended publication's political learning, and additionally recommends region-specific news articles. The intent is to broaden user's perspectives, and be more aware of the political bias that is present in their consumption of news.
